Create and deploy a dash application for exploring the gapminder dataset:

Get the Gapminder dataset (provided in this repo)
Create the basic dash application to display the dataset
Add callbacks that allow the user to:
Switch from linear to log scale on the axes
Change the data type displayed in the plot
Change the year being shown
Improve the layout and UI so that it is easy and relatively intuitive to use
Deploy your app (using a free account) to Heroku and send Henry the link.
Here is an example: https://dash-app-test-hm.herokuapp.com/
